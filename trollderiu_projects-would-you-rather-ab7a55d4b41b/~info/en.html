        <b>PUBLIC POLLS MODE:</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Democratic world seems going wrong and population can't take part of any political decision.
        We need to Update the meaning of democracy, to the Democracy 2.0!
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>HOW PUBLIC POLLS WORKS ? </b> The App will send you a SMS to verify and limit only 1 vote for personal phone number. This verification will be required the first time you want to vote on a public poll and every time we update your country phone code. This  allows us to face bots and multi-accounts. Phone numbers won't shared with third parties, and any personal information is required.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>WHAT ALLOWS PHONE CODES ? </b> Phone codes allows to make polls for a specific country, allowing to vote to anyone who is in that country.

        notes:<br/>
        • UUEE and Canada share the same '+1' phone code so can be some issues to recognize which country people is.<br/>
        • Offshores or protectorates islands could share phone codes between them without clear rules.<br/>
        • Some regions have codes inside countries, and they can vote as region and as country.<br/>
